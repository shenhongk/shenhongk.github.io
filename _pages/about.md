<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final-year dual-degree student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at **Polytech Nantes** (France) and **Ocean University of China**.  
My research interests include **computer vision**, **deep learning**, **multimodal learning**, and **medical image analysis**.  
I am particularly interested in bridging high-level semantics with low-level visual understanding, and developing reliable models for challenging real-world tasks.

Currently, I am completing a research internship at **INSERM (IMRB – U955)**, focusing on the supervised classification of liver adenomas from histopathology images, using features extracted by vision-language pre-trained models.
